##ACU-Insights 

ACU-Insights is a customization project that allows system administrators to collect user's data on how effectively Acumatica is used. The user is monitored for active/inactive time on a specific screen as well as elapsed time for completing a transaction. This data is then displayed on a Generic Inquiry (GI), which can be customized to show the data. An administrator or team could create views that show the average time per Order Entry, fastest Order Entry agent, agents with the most edits, etc. Currently it is functioning on the Sales Order and Accounts Receivable screens.

##Installation:
From within Acumatica Customization Projects, Upload and publish the project.
